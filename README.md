# About
Reddit Wallpaper Changer is a lightweight C# application for Windows that will scrape Reddit for desktop wallpapers. You can specify which subs to scrape from and how oftern to rotate your wallpaper.

# Current Version - 1.0.8.3
- Fixed issue with loading the Blacklisted.xml file before setting a new wallpaper (causes RWC to appear to hang on first load). Shout out to Reddit user /u/padrino257 for the spot.
- A couple of minor code changes.


# Installation
Either download the latest MSI installer or download the self extracting zip file from the [releases page](https://github.com/Rawns/Reddit-Wallpaper-Changer/releases)
